                  <br>
                  <p>The soil is the backbone of agriculture. Hence, it is essential to know about soil before farming.
                    Soils are of a variety of types, some are loamy and fertile while some are sandy and infertile.
                    Every type of soil is not suitable for every crop. The crops grown in fertile soil will not
                    necessarily give yield, because, for better quality, yield preparation of the soil is essential.</p>
                  <p>Letâ€™s see the properties and types of soil and methods to prepare the soil.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Soil Profile</h2><br>
                  <p>Soil formation is the combined result of physical, chemical and biological processes under certain
                    environmental conditions. The soil is a combination of biotic and abiotic components. It contains
                    microorganisms, worms, minerals, decaying organic matters, hummus, elements like water and air which
                    altogether makes the soil fertile and source of nutrients. The soil is mainly of three types: sandy
                    soil, clayey soil, and loamy soil. Among this loamy soil is more suitable for farming. An ideal soil
                    for agriculture has the following characteristics:<br>
                  <ol>
                    <li>=>Good water holding capacity</li>
                    <li>=>Proper aeration</li>
                    <li>=>Good consistency (texture)</li>
                    <li>=>Balanced acid and alkaline content</li>
                    <li>=>Rich in nutrients (micro and macronutrients)</li>
                  </ol>
                  </p><br><br>
                  <h2>Soil for Agriculture</h2><br>
                  <p> No soil is ideal hence it necessitates the preparation of the soil before and after the
                    cultivation. Soil fertility may be lost due to continuous farming; for the replenishment of soil
                    contents, it is prepared prior to sowing of seeds. In agriculture, ploughing, levelling, and
                    manuring are the three steps of soil preparation.</p><br>
                  <h4>Ploughing</h4><br>
                  <p>Ploughing includes loosening and digging of soil. During ploughing, the soil becomes loose and the
                    nutrients in deep soil come to the top. Also, aeration of soil will increase thus air is available
                    for breathing and roots are easily penetrated between soil. Other purposes of ploughing are the
                    integration of manure, uprooting of weeds, removal of infectious pathogens, insects etc. Ploughs of
                    wood or iron are used for this purpose. Bullocks or tractors are used to pull this plough. Hoe is
                    another tool used to uproot weeds and to loose soil.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Levelling</h4><br>
                  <p>Levelling helps in even distribution and soil is levelled after ploughing. A plank of wood or iron
                    is used for this. Levelling also helps in water distribution without logging during irrigation.</p>

                <div class="content">
                  <br>
                  <p>Agriculture is the art and ability to cultivate plants and other livestock. There are different
                    types of agriculture, and it plays a crucial role in the life of an economy. The main purpose of
                    agriculture is not only to cultivate crops, but it also provides employment for the large proportion
                    of the population, and it is the backbone of our economic system.</p><br>
                  <p>As we all are aware of, there are multiple steps to be followed in the agricultural process.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The first and the initial stage is the selection of the seeds. Seeds are the fundamental
                    requirement in most of the agricultural process. Before beginning with the cultivation, selecting
                    the best quality seeds is a challenging task for the farmers. Because only the good quality of seeds
                    give an expected result or yield. Therefore, farmers have to choose suitable seeds from the variety
                    of options available in the market.</p><br>
                  <p>Let us know more in detail about the selection and sowing of seeds.</p><br>
                  <p>Selection and sowing of seeds are two agricultural practices which demand extreme attention and
                    care.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Selection of Seeds</h2><br>
                  <p>Healthy and good quality seeds are the roots of a healthy crop. The seeds that are used to
                    cultivate new crops have to be selected very carefully and of high quality. The good quality seeds
                    can either be bought from different sources or farmers can produce by their own. The selection of
                    seeds is used to improve the quality of yields. There are several diseases that are transmitted via
                    the seeds. If the selected seeds are from the infected fields then the seed-borne diseases will
                    cause severe problems in the agricultural process. Thus, always obtain seeds from healthy plants.
                    Along with the diseases free and healthy seeds, farmers also need to check the germination period of
                    the seeds, nutrients required and other benefits in terms of yield and finance. Overall, selecting
                    good quality seeds are essential for growing strong and healthy crops.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Sowing of Seeds</h2><br>
                  <p>Sowing seeds is an essential part of crop production. After the preparation of soil, the previously
                    selected seeds are scattered in the field. This process is called sowing. Sowing should be done
                    carefully and evenly. If seeds are not sown uniformly, overcrowding of crops happens. For sufficient
                    sunlight, water and other requirements congestion need to be prevented. There are two different
                    methods of sowing the seeds. Traditionally, sowing is done manually by hands and in some places,
                    seed drilling machines are used.</p><br>
                  <h4>Traditional method or Sowing by hands</h4><br>
                  <p>This is the most common and generally practised method by all the farmers. This is a very simple
                    process, in which seeds are scattered by hands. This process is called broadcasting, which is the
                    most economical method. Here, seeds are sown either by hand or by using tools. Sowing of seeds by
                    hand is called broadcasting. This is common, but a uniform distribution is not maintained.</p><br>
                  <h4>Sowing by seed drilling machines</h4><br>
                  <p>This is a modern method used in some part of the world for sowing seeds. In this method, iron
                    drills or the funnels filled with seeds are connected to a tractor. As the plough moves, seeds are
                    distributed into the furrow made by the plough and are covered. This method is more advantageous
                    than the traditional method. In this method, seeds are distributed evenly at regular distances and
                    depth. This is profitable in terms of both labour and time.</p><br>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Adding Manure and Fertilizers</button>
                <div class="content">
                  <p><br>When crops are grown one after the other, it decreases the productivity of the soil. However,
                    this can be overcome by adding manures and fertilizers to the soil. This increases the yield of the
                    plants and also restores the productivity of the soil. Therefore, manures and fertilizers are
                    paramount for efficient crop production.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>What is Manure?</h2><br>
                  <p>Manure is obtained from the decomposition of dead plants and animals. They essentially function as
                    sustenance to the crops. They help in the proper cultivation of crops. Addition of manure enables
                    the soil to hold more water. Organic manures have acids that dissolve the nutrients with soil and
                    make it available to the plants.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Advantages of Manure</h2><br>
                  <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>=>It increases the water-holding capacity of the soil.</li>
                    <li>=>It makes the soil porous and facilitates the exchange of gases.</li>
                    <li>=>The texture of the soil improves.</li>
                    <li>=>The number of microbes increases in the soil.</li>
                  </ol>
                  </p><br>
                  <p>The process of adding manures is known as manuring. Manuring should be done at regular intervals,
                    otherwise, the plants become weak. However, the use of manure has many drawbacks too. They can be
                    rather difficult to transport and are not nutrient specific.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Fertilizers</h2><br>
                  <p>A fertilizer is a chemical substance that contains necessary nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium,
                    and phosphorous to make the soil fertile. Popular examples of fertilizers are urea, potash, and
                    ammonium sulphate.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Advantages of fertilizers</h2><br>
                  <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>=>They are quick in providing plant nutrients and restoring soil fertility.</li>
                    <li>=>They are portable and easy to transport.</li>
                    <li>=>Plants easily absorb fertilizers.</li>
                    <li>=>Fertilizers improve and increase the productivity of many crops such as wheat, maize, and rice
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  </p><br>
                  <p>However, these are chemicals, and they have the potential to decrease the fertility of soil if used
                    constantly. Furthermore, it also pollutes water bodies.</p><br>

                  <p><br>Water is an essential element for survival. About seventy per cent of the human body consists
                    of water while plants contain almost 90 per cent of water. Still, we have to depend on some outside
                    sources to fulfil the water requirements of our body.</p><br>

                  <p>Similarly, crops require water for their growth and development. The process of supplying water to
                    the crops is known as irrigation.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>What is Irrigation?</h2><br>
                  <p>Irrigation is the process of applying water to the crops artificially to fulfil their water
                    requirements. Nutrients may also be provided to the crops through irrigation. The various sources of
                    water for irrigation are wells, ponds, lakes, canals, tube-wells and even dams. Irrigation offers
                    moisture required for growth and development, germination and other related functions.</p><br>

                  <p>The frequency, rate, amount and time of irrigation are different for different crops and also vary
                    according to the types of soil and seasons. For example, summer crops require a higher amount of
                    water as compared to winter crops.</p><br>

                  <p>Let us have a look at different types of irrigation and the methods used for irrigation.</p>
                  <br><br>
                  <h2>Types of Irrigation</h2><br>
                  <p>There are different types of irrigation practised for improving crop yield. These types of
                    irrigation systems are practised based on the different types of soils, climates, crops and
                    resources. The main types of irrigation followed by farmers include:</p><br>
                  <h4>+ Surface Irrigation</h4><br>
                  <p>In this system, no irrigation pump is involved. Here, water is distributed across the land by
                    gravity.</p><br>
                  <h4>+ Localized Irrigation</h4><br>
                  <p>In this system, water is applied to each plant through a network of pipes under low pressure.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>+ Sprinkler Irrigation</h4><br>
                  <p>Water is distributed from a central location by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or from
                    sprinklers from the moving platform</p><br>
                  <h4>+ Drip Irrigation</h4><br>
                  <p>In this type, drops of water are delivered near the roots of the plants. This type of irrigation is
                    rarely used as it requires more maintenance.</p><br>
                  <h4>+ Centre Pivot Irrigation</h4><br>
                  <p>In this, the water is distributed by a sprinkler system moving in a circular pattern.</p><br>
                  <h4>+ Sub Irrigation</h4><br>
                  <p>Water is distributed through a system of pumping stations gates, ditches and canals by raising the
                    water table.</p><br>
                  <h4>+ Manual Irrigation</h4><br>
                  <p>This a labour intensive and time-consuming system of irrigation. Here, the water is distributed
                    through watering cans by manual labour.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Methods of Irrigation</h2><br>
                  <p>Irrigation can be carried out by two different methods:</p><br>
                  <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>=>Traditional Methods</li>
                    <li>=>Modern Methods</li>
                  </ol>
                  </p><br><br>
                  <h2>Traditional Methods of Irrigation</h2><br>
                  <p>In this method, irrigation is done manually. Here, a farmer pulls out water from wells or canals by
                    himself or using cattle and carries to farming fields. This method can vary in different regions.
                  </p><br>
                  <p>The main advantage of this method is that it is cheap. But its efficiency is poor because of the
                    uneven distribution of water. Also, the chances of water loss are very high.</p><br>
                  <p>Some examples of the traditional system are pulley system, lever system, chain pump. Among these,
                    the pump system is the most common and used widely.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Modern Methods of Irrigation</h2><br>
                  <p>The modern method compensates the disadvantages of traditional methods and thus helps in the proper
                    way of water usage.
                  <p><br>
                  <p>The modern method involves two systems:</p><br>
                  <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>=>Sprinkler system</li>
                    <li>=>Drip system</li>
                  </ol>
                  </p><br><br>
                  <h4>Sprinkler System</h4><br>
                  <p>A sprinkler system, as its name suggests, sprinkles water over the crop and helps in an even
                    distribution of water. This method is much advisable in areas facing water scarcity.</p><br>
                  <p>Here a pump is connected to pipes which generate pressure and water is sprinkled through nozzles of
                    pipes.</p><br>
                  <h4>Drip System</h4><br>
                  <p>In the drip system, water supply is done drop by drop exactly at roots using a hose or pipe. This
                    method can also be used in regions where water availability is less.</p><br> <br>
                  <h2>Importance of Irrigation</h2><br>
                  <p>The importance of irrigation can be explained in the following points:</p><br>
                  <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>=>Insufficient and uncertain rainfall adversely affects agriculture. Droughts and famines are
                      caused due to low rainfall. Irrigation helps to increase productivity even in low rainfall.</li>
                    <li>=>The productivity on irrigated land is higher as compared to the un-irrigated land.</li>
                    <li>=>Multiple cropping is not possible in India because the rainy season is specific in most of the
                      regions. However, the climate supports cultivation throughout the year. Irrigation facilities make
                      it possible to grow more than one crop in most of the areas of the country.</li>
                    <li>=>Irrigation has helped to bring most of the fallow land under cultivation.</li>
                    <li>=>Irrigation has stabilized the output and yield levels.</li>
                    <li>=>Irrigation increases the availability of water supply, which in turn increases the income of
                      the farmers.</li>
                  </ol>
                  </p><br>
                  <p>Irrigation should be optimum because even over-irrigation can spoil the crop production. Excess
                    water leads to waterlogging, hinder germination, increased salt concentration and uprooting because
                    roots canâ€™t withstand standing water. Thus the proper method is to be used for the best cultivation.

                  <p>To succeed in getting the best and the maximum yield from his farm, a farmer has to minimise his
                    crop loss and it demands proper and sustainable agricultural practices. By employing the right
                    agricultural practices he can aim to improve the yield of the crops. For improving the yield, a
                    farmer needs to improve the variety of crops, its production management, and its protection
                    management.</p><br>

                  <p>Here we will be discussing the crop protection management.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>What is Crop Protection?</h2><br>
                  <p>Crop protection is the general method or the practice of protecting the crop yields from different
                    agents including pests, weeds, plant diseases, and other organisms that cause damage to the
                    agricultural crops.</p><br>
                  <p>
                    Apart from crops, agricultural fields would have weeds, small animals like rats, mites, insects,
                    pests, disease-causing pathogens and frequently raided by birds. All these factors are mainly
                    responsible for the loss or damage to the crops. Thus to yield high crop production, farmers need to
                    protect the crop from these pests. Hence crop protection management is important before, during and
                    after the cultivation</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Why do we need Crop Protection?</h2><br>
                  <p>Globally, on average, every year farmers lose 20 to 30 (%) of their cultivated crops due to pests
                    and other diseases. In order to reduce these losses, crop protection is much more required. There
                    are different types of Crop Protection products available in the market and are eco-friendly or
                    environment-friendly products which help in preserving the environment and also protect the crops.
                    These products include â€“ Fungicides, Herbicides, Insecticides and Seed care.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>What are the methods of crop protection?</h2><br>
                  <p>There are many crop protection tools and practices, which farmers can implement to increase the
                    success of their crops.</p><br>
                  <h3>Crop protection before the cultivation</h3><br>
                  <h2>+ Weed Management</h2><br>
                  <p>Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a long-term management approach to manage weeds through certain
                    techniques. These techniques are a combination of biological, physical, chemical, mechanical and
                    cultural practices. Overall, these help to improve crop production, revenue, and environmental
                    condition. Before managing the weeds, we should know the definition and impact of weeds on various
                    components like environment, economic and other parts of society.</p><br>
                  <h4>What is Weed?</h4><br>
                  <p>Weeds are defined as the unwanted plants in crop fields which grow along with the main crop. They
                    are strong and dominating competitors for crops. Their copious seed production, quick population
                    establishment, and adaptation characteristics make them tough competitors and help in their
                    survival. Common examples of weeds are grass, algae, Amaranthus, Chenopodium.</p><br>
                  <p>Weeds compete for essential components required by crops. They compete for light, water, nutrients,
                    and space. They reduce the yield and sometimes they are sources of diseases as well</p><br><br>
                  <h4>Types of Weeds</h4><br>
                  <p>There are different types of weeding:</p><br>
                  <h4>>>Hand Pulling and Cultivation</h4><br>
                  <p>This refers to the process of weed removal by hands. Certain tools such as a shovel can be used for
                    the task.</p><br>
                  <h4>>>Pre-emergent herbicides</h4><br>
                  <p>Pre-emergent herbicides prevent the growth of weeds. It is applied to the surface of the ground
                    after planting perennial or annual plants. The plant should be in an active growth stage for
                    effective results.</p><br>
                  <h4>>>Mulches</h4><br>
                  <p>Mulches are spread on the garden to restrict the access of the sun to the weed seeds, thereby,
                    preventing the growth of the weeds</p><br><br>
                  <h4>Crop Protection through Weeding</h4><br>
                  <p>Weeding is the removal of weeds from the field. It is an effective pre-harvesting method of crop
                    protection and crop production management. Weeds act as competitors of the crop for various
                    resources required for growth like nutrients, light, water, etc. so it has to be removed as it may
                    cause interference and decrease the yield.</p><br>
                  <p>Weeds can be controlled in many ways. Weed management includes land preparation, water management,
                    hand weeding, hand hoeing, crop rotation, and herbicides.</p><br>
                  <p>Land preparation helps in the removal of seeds and uprooting of weeds before sowing of seeds of the
                    main crop. Hand weeding is done manually which is very tiresome and time-consuming.</p><br>
                  <p>Nowadays, weedicides and herbicides are most commonly used and are effective ways of weeding.
                    Chemicals like MCPA, 2,4-D are some commonly used weedicides. They can be applied at three stages
                    like before and after crop planting and after weed emergence. But these chemicals can cause health
                    hazards and environmental issues.</p><br>
                  <p>Weeds are beneficial to nature but it spoils the crop. Thus, weeds need to be controlled to prevent
                    their impact on living beings.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>+ Pests and Insects Management</h2><br>
                  <p>Both insects and pests are the major cause of crop damage and yield loss. They could ruin the whole
                    crop and eat up the large portion of grains. In fact, they can reduce crop output by 30-50(%) every
                    year if left unchecked. The best ways to protect crop damage are by incorporating integrated pest
                    and insect management. Spraying insecticides, pesticides help to minimize the crop damage by
                    controlling the insects and other pests.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>+ Plant Disease Management</h2><br>
                  <p>Pathogenic diseases are another type of crop-damaging factors. Microorganisms like bacteria, fungi,
                    and viruses affect different parts of the crop through various means. Crops could be protected from
                    these diseases by using pesticides and biocontrol agents.</p><br>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Harvesting and Storage</button>
                <div class="content">
                  <br>
                  <p>The ultimate stages of crop production are harvesting and storage.</p><br>

                  <p>Harvesting requires art and practice because a large proportion of crops can be lost due to
                    improper methods of harvesting. Another concern besides harvesting is storage. Storage of grains is
                    to be given utmost priority as improper storage can result in the destruction of crops being by
                    pests or unfavourable environmental conditions.</p><br>
                  <p>Thus, it requires proper knowledge of harvesting, methods of storage, and protection of grains,
                    which are discussed below.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Harvesting</h2><br>
                  <p>Once the crop is matured or fully ripen, they are cut and gathered (Reaping) which are collectively
                    called as harvesting. Harvesting depends on many factors like season, crop variety, maturity period,
                    etc.</p><br>
                  <p>Over-irrigation, irregular sunlight can prolong ripening of crop which thus delays the harvesting
                    time. Early harvesting causes loss of unripened grains while delayed harvesting leads to shedding
                    off of grains.</p><br>
                  <p>Besides this, rodents and even birds eat the grains. Therefore regular examination of the crop is
                    necessary as harvesting period approaches. The golden yellow colour is the indication of ripened
                    crops for paddy, rice, and wheat.</p><br>
                  <p>Manually harvesting is done by using sickles but it is a tedious job as well as time-consuming. In
                    recent times, machines called harvesters are used for harvesting, especially in large-scale farming.
                  </p><br>
                  <p>Followed by harvesting, threshing of the crop has to be performed. Threshing is the process, in
                    which, the collected grains are separated from the chaff by beating or by the threshing machine. In
                    small-scale farming, chaff and grains are separated from each other by a process called winnowing.
                  </p><br>
                  <p>Harvesting is considered as a festival in most part of the country. It is a time of joy where the
                    fruits of the hard work of farmers come into reality. Some of the harvesting festivals are Pongal,
                    Bihu, etc.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Storage</h2><br>
                  <p>In the case of small-scale cultivation, farmers use the harvested crop for themselves while
                    large-scale production is mainly for marketing. Thus the cultivators have to store the grains. For
                    this, proper storage space has to be arranged. Inadequate storage space and improper storage methods
                    can lead to a huge grain loss.</p><br>
                  <p>In addition to pest and rodents, microbes like bacteria, fungi, and environmental conditions such
                    as moisture and temperature might attack the stored grains. Therefore, proper treatment is required
                    before the grains are stored.</p><br>
                  <p>Rodent infestations can be prevented by pesticides. A moist environment results in fungal growth on
                    grains. This can be avoided by proper drying of grains in sunlight.</p><br>
                  <p>Another method is fumigation where chemicals are used to prevent bacteria and other microorganisms.
                    After proper treatments, grains have to be stored in gunny bags or granaries and deposited in
                    godowns.</p><br>
                  <p>Thus we see how harvesting and storage of grains form an important part of crop production.</p><br>
